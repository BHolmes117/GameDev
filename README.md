#A video game where you will collect the pages and not get caught

We created a little game that will task you with completing a task within the game inorder to survie before it is too late. In the program we have implemented screens such that they give you instructions on what you need to in order to play the game. For this program to work you will need to make sure you have the GX toolkit installed into your computer for the program to run properly.

This is a C++ program and it was built in Microsoft Visual Studio, make sure you run the code in there and nowhere else. Once you have done so the program and game will run smoothly, just follow the instructions in the game and have fun.
